Colors in PS Expansions :

\c initiates a color marker.
The marker must end with a color letter, otherwise the next letter will be interpreted as one and will be removed.
Color letters are as follow :
n : black
r : red
g : green
y : yellow
b : blue
p : purple
c : cyan
any other letter : white

\cr will put all following characters in red.

Capital color letters will also put the text in bold.
\cR will put all following characters in bold red.

Color parameters allows more styling and must be written between the color marker and the color letter.
They can either be only letters, or only numbers.
Letter color parameters :
i : italic
s : underlined
d : blinking
I : inverted

\cisR will put all following characters in italic underlined bold red.

Numeric color parameters :
0 : None
1 : Bold
2 : Italic
3 : Underlined
4 : Blinking
5 : Inverted

\c123r is the same as \c23R and the same as \cisR.

!! Be careful while working with styling ! Styling will be kept until removed by a no-styler.
If you have a bold text at some point, you need to remove it by adding either a color without parameter or a color with a NULL parameter.
-> "\cR All text is bold and red \cr but not anymore"
-> "\ciR All text has style \c0r but not anymore"


To sum it all up, colors markers can be pretty tricky. So if you don't want to fool around much with them, I recommand you to only use \c with lowercase and uppercase letters, so you have colors and bold characters.
