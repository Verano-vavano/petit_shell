Functionalities :
Braces, tilde and parameter expansion
- Braces include inbracated (and not) coma expansion and not inbricated dots expansion
- Tilde expansion searches extensively before giving up (its determined)
- $var && ${var} works. Handles ${#var}
Command substitution
- Handles $(cmd) which replaces it with the stdout of cmd
Filename expansion
- Handles partial search (l* searches for files that start with l)
- Handles both * and ?
Word split
- According to IFS
Quote removal (for both cmd and heredoc delim)
Execution using only 3 fds
Local and exported environment
Fully functional history
- History file can be changed with var. HISTFILE. History size can be changed with HISTSIZE and the history file size can be changed with HISTFILESIZE.
&& || ;
< << <<< > >> <>
- Better file management, as we close useless files, whereas bash keeps them until the end of the cmd
- Heredocs succesfully handled. ^D ends it the same way as Bash.
Redirection from fd to fd (n<&m)
Syntax error handling
Taking variables into account (IFS, CDPATH)
PS1, PS2
Signal handling
2 builtin easter eggs (tetris, hell)
- Fully functional Tetris working with Termcap and Termios. The forking for the internal timer might be a bit heavy, but without threads, it was the only way. Cannot work without sleep.
- Hell is a builtin printing a pun around the metal genre. We hardcoded a new random function using the asm instruction to generate pseudo-random number to choose the pun. And they all are funny.
